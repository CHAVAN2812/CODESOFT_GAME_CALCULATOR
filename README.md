# CODESOFT_GAME_CALCULATOR
This interactive game generates a random number (e.g., 1 to 100) and prompts the user to guess it, providing feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. With limited attempts, multiple rounds, and a scoring system based on attempts or rounds won, the game offers a challenging and engaging experience to improve guessing skills.
